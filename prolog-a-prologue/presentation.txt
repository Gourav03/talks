What is Prolog?
# Prolog was created in 1972 by Alain Colmerauer, and it's a logic programming
# language - a set of sentences expressing facts and rules.
# Used commonly today for natural language processing

So...

What's a
Declarative
Language?

Imperative Languages

Where you tell the compiler
(or interpreter) what to do

Java
JavaScript
Ruby
C#
Python
PHP
etc.

Isn't that how ALL programming works?

Not Always

Declarative Languages

Where you describe to the compiler
(or interpreter) what you want - but not
exactly how to do it
