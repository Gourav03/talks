Running a Rails
API with Docker

By:
     Aaron Krauss

What is Docker?

We'll get there
    Baby Steps

Our Game Plan:
Send an email

@images/mind-blown.png

But not just any email

An email when a new
comment is created

An email that is sent to the
creator of the post

An email

For all man kind

How will we do this?

Our Process
▸ Generate mailer
▸ Hook up sidekiq
▸ Send to maildev

That's a lot of services

4 to be exact

▸ Rails server
▸ Sidekiq
▸ Redis
▸ Maildev

No
Docker
Yet?

NO

but...

@images/soon.png

Let's code!

Phase 2
      Put some Docker
      in there

What is Docker?

@images/docker.png

Let's rebuild
everything
in Docker

@images/not-amused.png

But for real.
Let's code.
